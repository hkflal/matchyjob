# HK Job Pro - Supabase MCP Setup Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy to verify all completed Supabase MCP setup tasks. The testing plan ensures that the database infrastructure, security policies, functions, and integrations are working correctly.

## Test Environment
- **Project URL**: https://qqukgtbqpihgvaebbetj.supabase.co
- **Environment**: Development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Testing Framework**: Node.js + Jest + Supabase Client

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Database Schema Testing
**Objective**: Verify all database objects exist and are properly configured

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Verify all custom types exist (user_role, remote_type, job_type, etc.)
- ✅ Verify all tables exist with correct structure
- ✅ Verify foreign key relationships are established
- ✅ Verify column constraints and defaults
- ✅ Verify unique constraints and indexes

**Test Script**: `tests/database-schema.test.js`

#### 1.2 Row Level Security (RLS) Testing
**Objective**: Ensure data access is properly restricted by user roles

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Job Seeker Access**:
  - Can view active jobs
  - Can create applications for jobs
  - Can view/edit own profile and applications only
  - Cannot access employer-only data
  
- **Employer Access**:
  - Can create/edit own company profile
  - Can create/edit jobs for their company
  - Can view applications for their jobs only
  - Cannot access other employers' data
  
- **Admin Access**:
  - Can view all data
  - Can modify any records
  - Can access administrative functions

**Test Script**: `tests/rls-policies.test.js`

#### 1.3 Functions and Triggers Testing
**Objective**: Verify database functions and triggers work correctly

**Test Cases**:
- **Profile Auto-Creation**: Test `handle_new_user()` trigger
- **Timestamp Updates**: Test `update_updated_at_column()` trigger
- **Job View Tracking**: Test `increment_job_views()` function

**Test Script**: `tests/functions-triggers.test.js`

#### 1.4 Storage Buckets Testing
**Objective**: Verify file upload capabilities and security policies

**Test Cases**:
- **Resumes Bucket**: Private access, user-only upload/download
- **Company Logos Bucket**: Public read, company owner write
- **Avatars Bucket**: Public read, user owner write

**Test Script**: `tests/storage-buckets.test.js`

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Authentication Integration Testing
**Objective**: Test complete auth flow with profile creation

**Test Cases**:
- User registration creates profile automatically
- Profile data matches registration metadata
- Role assignment works correctly
- Email confirmation flow

**Test Script**: `tests/auth-integration.test.js`

#### 2.2 TypeScript Types Testing
**Objective**: Verify generated types work with actual database operations

**Test Cases**:
- Import and use database types
- Type safety in CRUD operations
- Enum type validation
- Relationship type checking

**Test Script**: `tests/typescript-types.test.js`

#### 2.3 Complete Workflow Testing
**Objective**: Test end-to-end user scenarios

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Job Posting Workflow**: Employer creates company → posts job → manages applications
- **Job Application Workflow**: Job seeker registers → searches jobs → applies → tracks status
- **Company Management**: Create company profile → upload logo → manage team

**Test Script**: `tests/workflow-integration.test.js`

### Phase 3: Performance and Security (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Database Performance Testing
**Objective**: Verify query performance with sample data

**Test Cases**:
- Index usage in job searches
- Full-text search performance
- Query execution time limits (<100ms for simple queries)
- Pagination performance with large datasets

**Test Script**: `tests/performance.test.js`

#### 3.2 Security Advisor Testing
**Objective**: Identify security vulnerabilities and missing policies

**Test Cases**:
- Run Supabase security advisors
- Check for missing RLS policies
- Verify secure function definitions
- Test SQL injection resistance

**Test Script**: `tests/security-audit.test.js`

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing (Low Priority)

#### 4.1 Backup and Recovery Testing
**Objective**: Verify data protection capabilities

**Test Cases**:
- Database backup procedures
- Point-in-time recovery
- Migration rollback capabilities

#### 4.2 Load Testing
**Objective**: Test system under concurrent usage

**Test Cases**:
- Concurrent user authentication
- Simultaneous job posting/application
- Database connection pool limits
- API rate limiting

## Test Data Setup

### Sample Data Requirements
```sql
-- Test Users
INSERT INTO auth.users (id, email) VALUES 
  ('job-seeker-1', 'jobseeker@test.com'),
  ('employer-1', 'employer@test.com'),
  ('admin-1', 'admin@test.com');

-- Test Companies
INSERT INTO companies (id, name, owner_id, verified) VALUES
  ('company-1', 'Test Tech Corp', 'employer-1', true);

-- Test Jobs
INSERT INTO jobs (id, title, company_id, posted_by, status) VALUES
  ('job-1', 'Software Engineer', 'company-1', 'employer-1', 'active');
```

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:supabase

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:schema
npm run test:rls
npm run test:functions
npm run test:storage
npm run test:integration
npm run test:performance
npm run test:security

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage:supabase
```
