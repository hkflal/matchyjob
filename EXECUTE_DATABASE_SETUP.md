## STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION (5 minutes)

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your **HK Job Pro** project
4. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### 2. Execute Complete Setup Script
1. Click **"New Query"** in SQL Editor
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents from: `scripts/complete-setup.sql` (312 lines)
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

**Expected Result:** You should see "Success. No rows returned" or similar success message.

### 3. Verify Tables Created
After execution, go to **"Table Editor"** and verify these tables exist:
- ✅ profiles
- ✅ companies 
- ✅ jobs
- ✅ applications
- ✅ saved_jobs

node scripts/simple-test.js
```

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If SQL Execution Fails:
1. **Check for existing types:** If you see "type already exists" errors, that's OK
2. **Check for permissions:** Make sure you're project owner/admin
3. **Execute in parts:** If complete script fails, run individual files from `scripts/` folder

### Common Success Messages:
- "Success. No rows returned"
- "Success. X rows affected"
- Some warnings about existing objects are OK

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After setup completion, you should have:
- [ ] All 6 tables created and visible in Table Editor
- [ ] All 3 storage buckets created
- [ ] RLS policies enabled (check Authentication > Policies)
- [ ] Functions created (check Database > Functions)
